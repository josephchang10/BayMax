## Features

* Interface builder designable
* Highly customizable 
* Animation for progress and value text built in
* Written in Swift 3 and using Xcode 8

## Installation 

### CocoaPods (Recommended)

1. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)
2. Add this repo to your `Podfile`

	```ruby
	target 'Example' do
		# IMPORTANT: Make sure use_frameworks! is included at the top of the file
		use_frameworks!

		pod 'UICircularProgressRing'
	end
	```
3. Run `pod install`
4. Open up the `.xcworkspace` that CocoaPods created
5. Done!

__Note:__ If you have any issues with Swift 3 and CocoaPods you can try to force the version. (Cocoapods support for Swift 3 projects has been a bit wonky).

Add this to the end of your `Podfile`

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |configuration|
      configuration.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = "3.0"
    end
  end
end
```

### Carthage

**_Important note_: Carthage support for IBDesignable and IBInspectable is broken due to how frameworks work.
So if you decide on using Carthage, you will not be able to use IB to design this view.
Take a look [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/335) for the issue.**

To use with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

1. Make sure Carthage is installed 
	
	`brew install carthage`
2. Add this repo to your Cartfile

	`github "luispadron/UICircularProgressRing"` 
3. Drag the `UICircularProgressRing.framework` from `MyProjDir/Carthage/Builds/iOS/UICircularProgressRing` into the `General -> Embeded Binaries` section of your Xcode project.

### Manually

1. Simply download the `UICircularProgressRingView.swift`, `UICircularProgressRingLayer.swift` and `UICiruclarProgressRingDelegate.swift` files from [here](https://github.com/luispadron/UICircularProgressRing/tree/master/UICircularProgressRing) into your project, make sure you point to your projects target

## Usage

### Interface Builder

Simply drag a `UIView` into your storyboard. Make sure to subclass `UICircularProgressRingView` and that the module points `UICircularProgressRing`. 

Design your heart out

![ib-demo.gif](/GitHubAssets/ib-demo.gif)

### Code

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
  // Create the view
  let progressRing = UICircularProgressRingView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 240, height: 240))
  // Change any of the properties you'd like
  progressRing.maxValue = 50
  progressRing.innerRingColor = UIColor.blue
  // etc ...
}
```

To set a value and animate the view

```swift
// Somewhere not in viewDidLoad (since the views have not set yet, thus cannot be animated)
// Remember to use unowned or weak self if refrencing self to avoid retain cycle
progressRing.setProgress(value: 49, animationDuration: 2.0) {
  print("Done animating!")
  // Do anything your heart desires...
}
```

## Documentation

Please read this before creating an issue about how to use the package:

[DOCUMENTATION](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/luispadron/UICircularProgressRing/blob/master/docs/index.html)

## Example project

Take a look at the example project over [here](Example/)

1. Download it
2. Open the `Example.xcworkspace` in Xcode
3. Mess around and experiment!
